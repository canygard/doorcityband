	<h1>Door City Over Here...</h1>
		<p>One day in March 2023, four portals appeared underneath the feet of four handsome and unsuspecting gentlemen. On that day, they joined forces to become Door City. Since that day, Door City has been one of the most prolific alternative rock bands in the Salt Lake area, and the music industry at large.</p>
			<p>Door City has two singles, Remedy and Feel Right, created with only half of the band's full might. A much more polished EP is in the works and it is going to be awesome sauce. Stay tuned for more music and show announcements by joining your fellow Door Citizens on Instagram.</p>
			
			<p>A special thank you is due to <a href="https://andrewsmith.graphics/" target="new">Andrew Smith</a> for suggesting the band name, Nathan Fielder for being the most genius television creator of our time, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grayson.tries.photography/" target="new">Grayson Osterberg</a> for the photos.</p>

	<h1>Connor</h1>
	
	<p>
Born in a cacophony of bubbling flasks in 2003, Connor was a science experiment gone rogue, aiming to clone Zach Braff but settling for a quirky escape artist. Mastering the art of bass post-lab breakout, his notes carry a hint of rebellion and a splash of funk, proving that even failed clones can find their groove.</p>

	<h1>Carson</h1>
	
	<p>Carson, the sonic storyteller of our ensemble, emerged from the aisles of Walmart with a voice that transcends the monotony of retail life. Discovered amidst a spontaneous karaoke session near the canned goods section, his vocals soared higher than the discount prices. However, his tenure at Walmart was abruptly terminated after an unforgettable rendition of "Sicko Mode" by Drake over the store intercom.</p>

	<h1>Sam</h1>
	
	<p>Forged in the rhythmic crucible of both beats and bytes, Sam, the percussive maestro of our band, discovered his calling amidst the thunderous hum of propellers. By day, he navigates the skies as a drone pilot, orchestrating aerial ballets with the precision of a metronome. Rumor has it that his drumming skills were honed during covert missions, where he synchronized beats with the whirring propellers of his airborne companions.</p>

	<p>Ben is rumored to be the result of a secret collaboration between a guitar-playing wizard and a time-traveling sushi chef. Legend has it that he was conceived amidst a whirlwind of cherry blossoms in the heart of Tokyo.</p>
